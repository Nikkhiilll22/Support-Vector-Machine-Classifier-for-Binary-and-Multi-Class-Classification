# Support-Vector-Machine-Classifier-for-Binary-and-Multi-Class-Classification
In this project, I implemented the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to solve classification problems using real-world datasets. The goal was to distinguish between different classes based on input features using both linear and non-linear kernels. The project includes preprocessing steps such as handling null values, scaling features, splitting data, and evaluating performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports. This work demonstrates how SVMs can be a powerful supervised learning method for both binary and multi-class problems.
